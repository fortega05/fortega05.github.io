        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to My Recipe Book! This website was created as a personal project
            to bring together recipes from different cultures, backgrounds, and traditions.

        <h2>Why I Made This Website</h2>
        <p>
            I have always enjoyed cooking and trying foods from many different cultures.
            Food is a powerful way to connect people, tell stories, and share traditions.
        </p>
        <p>
            I created this website to organize my favorite recipes and to build a recipe book
            that anyone can explore, learn from, and enjoy.

        <h2>Sharing Diverse Recipes</h2>
        <p>
            This recipe book is meant to be inclusive and welcoming to everyone.
            Whether a recipe comes from family traditions, cultural heritage,
            or personal creativity, all food deserves to be shared.
        </p>
        <p>
            The goal is to create a space where people can add recipes, share ideas,
            and celebrate diversity through cooking.
